    <h4 class="desc ">99 Rue Tchernavaya, Moscow. A large garret lit by oil lamps hung from ceiling. Some masked men standing silent
        and apart from one another. A man in a scarlet mask is writing at a table. Door at back.
        Man in yellow with drawn sword at it. Knocks heard. Figures in cloaks
        and masks enter._</h4>
    <h4 class="prince">PRINCE PETRO</h4>
    <p>He is beginning well, this young Czar.</p>
    <h4 class="baron">BARON RAFF</h4>
    <p>All young Czars do begin well.</p>
    <h4 class="count">COUNT R.</h4>
    <p>And end badly.</p>
    <h4 class="MARQ. DE POIV ">MARQ. DE POIV </h4>
    <p>Well, I have no right to complain. He has done me one
        good service, at any rate.
    </p>
    <h4 class="prince ">PRINCE PETRO</h4>
    <p>Cancelled your appointment to Archangel, I suppose</p>
    <h4 class="MARQ. DE POIV ">MARQ. DE POIV</h4>
    <p>Yes; my head wouldn't have been safe there for an
        hour.</p>
    <h4 class="baron">BARON RAFF</h4>
    <p>Ah! General, any more news of our romantic Emperor?.</p>
    <h4 class="GEN. KOTEMK ">GEN. KOTEMK</h4>
    <p>You are quite right to call him romantic, Baron; a week ago
        I found him amusing himself in a garret with a company of strolling
        players; to-day his whim is all the convicts in Siberia are to be
        recalled, and political prisoners, as he calls them, amnestied.</p>
    <h4 class="prince">PRINCE PETRO</h4>
    <p>Political prisoners! Why, half of them are no better than
        common murderers!.</p>
    <h4 class="count  ">COUNT R</h4>
    <p>And the other half much worse?</p>
    <h4 class="barron ">BARON RAFF</h4>
    <p>Oh, you wrong them, surely, Count. Wholesale trade has
        always been more respectable than retail..</p>
    <h4 class="count">COUNT R</h4>
    <P>But he is really too romantic. He objected yesterday to my
        having the monopoly of the salt tax. He said the people had a right to
        have cheap salt.</P>
    <h4 class="MARQ. DE POIV">MARQ. DE POIV</h4>
    <p>Oh, that's nothing; but he actually disapproved of a
        State banquet every night because there is a famine in the Southern
        provinces.</p>
    <h4 class="prince "> PRINCE PETRO</h4>
    <P>Quelle b√©tise! The more starvation there is among the
        people, the better. It teaches them self-denial, an excellent virtue,
        Baron, an excellent virtue.</P>
    <h4 class="barron">BARON RAFF</h4>
    <p>Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms, like a
        malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had the pestilence; to
        sigh, like a school-boy that had
        lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes diet; to
        watch like one that fears robbing; to speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were wont, when you laughed,
        to crow like a cock;
        when you walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you looked
        sadly, it was for want of money: and now you are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look on you, I can
        hardly think you my
        master.
    </p>
    <h4 class="GEN. KOTEMK">GEN. KOTEMK</h4>
    <p> He talked of a Parliament, too, in Russia, and said the
        people should have deputies to represent them.</p>
    <h4 class="barron">BARON RAFF</h4>
    <p>As if there was not enough brawling in the streets already,
        but we must give the people a room to do it in. But, Messieurs, the
        worst is yet to come. He threatens a complete reform in the public
        service on the ground that the people are too heavily taxed.
        .</p>
    <h4 class="MARQ. DE POIV">MARQ. DE POIV</h4>
    <p>He can't be serious there. What is the use of the people
        except to get money out of? But talking of taxes, my dear Baron, you
        must really let me have forty thousand roubles to-morrow? my wife says
        she must have a new diamond bracelet.</p>
    <h4 class="count">COUNT R</h4>
    <p>Ah, to match the one Prince Paul gave
        her last week, I suppose.</p>
    <h4 class="prince">PRINCE PETRO</h4>
    <p>I must have sixty thousand roubles at once, Baron. My son
        is overwhelmed with debts of honour which he can't pay.
    </p>
    <h4 class="barron">BARON RAFF</h4>
    <p>What an excellent son to imitate his father so carefully!
